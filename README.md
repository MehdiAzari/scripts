# Scripts
Useful scripts that makes life easier :)

# How To Use?
**Copy** your movies and subtitles in same directory/folder. </br>
  Run using Linux Shell [(How to install ubunto bash on windows)](https://altis.com.au/installing-ubuntu-bash-for-windows-10)
```sh
  ./arrangeMovies.sh 
```
Enter starting number of episode then the ending number.
### Warning!
  I emphasized on coping the files because there might be flaw in this code and I don't want to make you sad :)
  make sure to have back-up files before you test the script.
